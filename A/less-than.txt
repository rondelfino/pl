Syntax:
	e1 < e2, where e1 and e2 are expressions

Type-checking:
	e1 and e2 must have the same type, and this type must be
	either real or int
	the result of the entire expression is bool

Evaluation rules:
	first evalutate e1 to a value, v1
	then evaluate e2 to a value, v2
	if v1 is less-than v2, then the result of the expression is true
	else, if v1 is not less-than v2, then the result of the expression is false
